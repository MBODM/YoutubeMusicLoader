# YoutubeMusicLoader
A tiny UI for the "youtube-dl" console app.

### How to use:

#### Step 1
- Download release and extract contents of zip file into some folder.
- Create a subfolder named "Tools" in that folder.
- Create a subfolder named "Music" in that folder.

#### Step 2
- Download "youtube-dl.exe" (see "youtube-dl" project on GitHub at https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl).
- Put the "youtube-dl.exe" into the "Tools" folder mentioned above.

#### Step 3
- Download the "ffmpeg" binaries ("ffmpeg.exe" and "ffprobe.exe") from https://www.ffmpeg.org because the "youtube-dl" app needs them to work properly (see project site of "youtube-dl").
- Put them also into the "Tools" folder mentioned above.

#### Step 4
Start the program, insert some Youtube link, click "Download" and you will find your mp3 file in the "Music" subfolder.

#### Step 5
Have fun.
